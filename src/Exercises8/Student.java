/*
* (a) Write the code for the Student class discussed in self-test question 2
above. You should note that in order to ensure that a double is returned
from the calculateAverageMark method you should specifically
divide the total of the three marks by 3.0 and not simply by 3 (look back at
Chap. 2 to remind yourself why this is the case).
Another thing to think about is what you choose for the initial values of the
marks. If you chose to give each mark an initial value of zero, this could be
ambiguous; a mark of zero could mean that the mark simply has not been
enteredâ€”or it could mean the student actually scored zero in the subject!
Can you think of a better initial value?
You can assume that the fees for the student are set initially to 3000.
